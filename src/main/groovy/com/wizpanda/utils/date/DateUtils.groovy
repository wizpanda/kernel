     *
     * <code>
     *     Date dateCreatedStart = new Date("03/31/2016")
     *     Date dateCreatedEnd = dateCreatedStart + 1
     *
     *     User.withCriteria {
     *          between("dateCreated", dateCreated, dateCreatedEnd)
     *     }
     * </code>
     *
     * Doing this will get all user's who are created at 31st March but will be also get those user's who are
     * registered on sharp 1st Apr 2016 00:00 due to inclusive of end date. So this method will get the end date by
     * incrementing the day by one by decrementing one millisecond just to complete one exact date range.
     *
     * @param date
     * @return
